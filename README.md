# UT-Course-Availability-Tracker

This Python script, tailored specifically for the University of Texas at Austin, is currently undergoing early testing to streamline course enrollment processes. Designed to address the challenges of course waitlists, the script monitors the availability of courses and alerts users when a spot becomes open. Please note that this tool is in its early testing phase and is currently limited to UT Austin's course system.

In the dynamic academic environment of UT Austin, certain courses may lack a waitlist option, requiring vigilant monitoring to secure enrollment. This script automates the process, continuously checking for status changes and notifying users via text message when a coveted course becomes available. By leveraging this tool during its early testing phase, users can gain a competitive edge in course selection and enrollment.
