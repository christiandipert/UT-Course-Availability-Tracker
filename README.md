# UT-Course-Availability-Tracker

Are you a UT Austin student TIRED of not getting your classes??? Are you someone that hates classes that don't have waitlists and wish you could hire a team of 1000 to constantly monitor a closed class in case it opens up so you can snipe a spot??? HAVE NO FEAR! This script allows you to constantly refresh the status of a current course as well as get the status of past courses. SNIPE your classes with EASE.

# NOTE:
This script is in EARLY TESTING and ONLY WORKS IF DUO MOBILE IS SET TO CALL YOU! OTHERWISE it will NOT WORK! I am working to hopefully add functionality for mobile app users and text message users.

# Key Features:

- Specifically tailored for the UT course system.
- Allows you to 'snipe' non-waitlisted classes that randomly open and close.
- Customizable settings to meet individual preferences and needs.

### Usage:

To get started, first install the dependencies required for the script:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, create a file titled "credentials.py" with the following format:
```python
USERNAME='your_UT_eid_here'
PASSWORD='your_password_here'
```

To run the script, simply navigate to the command line and run:
```python
python courseTrack.py -h
```
